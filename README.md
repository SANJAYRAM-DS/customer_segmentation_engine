# Customer Intelligence System

The **Customer Intelligence System** creates a **single, consistent, predictive view of each customer**, transforming raw behavioral data into **actionable signals**:

- **Customer Segment** (behavioral & value-based)
- **Churn Risk** (probability of disengagement)
- **Customer Lifetime Value** (expected future revenue)

This enables the business to **shift from hindsight analytics to foresight decision-making**, driving revenue growth through retention optimization, cost reduction by targeting interventions, and improved customer experience via personalization.

## Backend Deployment (Hugging Face Spaces)
