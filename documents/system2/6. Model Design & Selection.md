**# Model Architecture**
**## Baseline Models##**
Baseline models establish minimum acceptable performance and serve as continuous sanity checks.
**### Naive Baselines###**
* Last observed value
* Seasonal naive (same weekday / same week last year)
* Moving average over recent periods
**### Statistical Models###**
* Exponential Smoothing (SES, Holt, Holt–Winters)
* ARIMA / SARIMA for stable, low-volatility series
* Croston-style methods for intermittent demand
**### Baselines are simple, fast, interpretable, and used for:###**
* Early warning when advanced models degrade
* Cold-start SKUs
* Fallback during data or system failures

**## Advanced Models##**
Advanced models are introduced only where they materially outperform baselines.
**### Classical ML Models###**
* Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM)
* Random Forests for non-linear interactions
* Quantile regression variants for uncertainty estimation
**### Used when:###**
* Demand is influenced by promotions and external signals
* Feature interactions are complex but explainability is required
**### Deep Learning Models###**
* Temporal CNNs or RNNs or LSTM or GRU for long-range temporal patterns
* Transformer-based models for high-dimensional, multi-SKU forecasting
* Sequence-to-sequence architectures for multi-step forecasts
**### Used when:###**
* Large historical data exists
* Cross-series learning improves accuracy
* Latency and cost constraints allow

**## Model Selection Rationale##**
Model selection balances accuracy, interpretability, operational cost, and robustness.
* **### Simple models preferred for:###**
* Low-volume SKUs
* Stable demand patterns
* High explainability requirements
* **### Complex models justified only when:###**
* They significantly outperform baselines
* Gains persist under backtesting and live monitoring
* **### Ensemble approaches used selectively to reduce variance###**
Models are chosen per segment, not globally.

**## Retraining Cost##**
Retraining strategies are aligned with operational constraints.
* **### Baselines and statistical models:###**
* Retrain frequently (daily or weekly)
* Low compute cost
* **### Tree-based models:###**
* Retrain weekly or monthly
* Incremental updates where supported
* **### Deep learning models:###**
* Retrain less frequently
* Warm-start or fine-tune using recent data
Retraining frequency is adjusted based on:
* Data drift signals
* Performance decay
* Business calendar events
