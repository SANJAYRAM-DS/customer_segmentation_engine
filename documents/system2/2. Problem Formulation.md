**# Problem Formulation**
**## ML Tasks**
The system decomposes the Demand & Inventory problem into three distince ML task, each with a different objective and learning formulation.

**### Demand Forecasting**
**Task Type:** Time series forecasting(regression over time)
The goal is to estimate future demand quantities for each SKU at each location over defined forecast horizons (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

The forecasting task captures:
* Trend and seasonality
* Promotion effects
* Calendar and external influences
* Demand volatility and uncertainty
This task produces probabilistic forecast, not single-point estimated, to support downstream risk-aware decisions.

**### Hierarchical Reconciliation**
**Task Type:** Structured forecasting / constraint-based reconciliation
Demand exists across multiple hierarchical levels:
* SKU
* Category
* Store
* Region
Forecast generated independently at different levels may be inconsistent. This task reconciles forecast so that lower_level predictions aggregate coherently to higher-level totals
The reconciliation process enforces structural consistency without overwriting local demand patterns, enabling reliable planning across organizational reporting levels.

**### Stock-Out Risk Prediction**
**Task Type:** Binary classification and anomaly detection
The goal is to predict the likelihood that available inventory for a given SKU and location will fall below zero before the next replenishment opportunity.
This task combines:
* Forecasted demand distributions
* Supplier lead times
* Inventory buffers and safety stock
* Demand volatility signals
This output is a risk score rather than a hard decision, enabling proritized intervention

**## Target Variables**
Each ML task has explicitly defined target variables:

**### Demand Forecasting**
* **Target:** Future sales quantity
* **Observed from:** Historical transaction data aggregated by SKU, location, and time window
* **Nature:** Continuous, time-indexed

**### Hierarchical Reconciliation**
* **Target:** Constraint-consistent demand estimates
* **Observed from:** Aggregated sales at multiple hierarchy levels
* **Nature:** Derived, structure-enforced targets

**### Stock-Out Risk Prediction**
* **Target:** Stock-out occurrence within a defined future horizon
* **Observed from:** Inventory balance crossing zero before replenishment
* **Nature:** Binary event with time dependency
Targets are computed using time-aware labeling to prevent future information leakage.

**## Temporal Nature**
This system is inherently temporal and operates on evolving data streams.
* Demand patterns change due to seasonality, promotions, and market trends
* Inventory positions evolve with sales, replenishments, and lead-time variability
* Forecast accuracy and risk signals degrade over time as conditions change
All features, labels, and evaluations are constructed with explicit reference times, and models are trained and evaluated using rolling and backtesting windows to reflect real-world deployment conditions.
The system supports:
* Sliding training windows
* Time-based retraining schedules
* Drift-aware performance monitoring

**## Explicit Non-Goals**
To prevent scope creep and model misuse, the following are explicitly out of scope:
* Automatic inventory ordering or supplier negotiation
* Optimization of order quantities or safety stock levels
* End-to-end supply chain optimization
* Prediction of rare, external black-swan events
* Replacement of human planning and judgment
This system focuses on prediction and risk signaling, leaving optimization and execution to downstream systems and human operators.
