**# Data Sources & Quality**
**## Data Sources**
The Demand & Inventory Intelligence System relies on multiple internal data sources that capture sales, inventory movement, and operational context.
**### Primary Data Sources**
* **Sales Transactions Table**
* SKU identifier
* Store / location identifier
* Quantity sold
* Transaction timestamp
* **Inventory Snapshot Table**
* SKU and location
* On-hand quantity
* Safety stock levels
* Snapshot timestamp
* **Replenishment & Procurement Table**
* SKU and supplier
* Order quantities
* Expected and actual delivery dates
* Lead times
**### Contextual & Enrichment Data**
* **Product Master Data**
* SKU category and hierarchy
* Product lifecycle status
* **Store / Location Metadata**
* Store type, region
* Operating calendar
* **Promotion & Pricing Calendar**
* Promotion start and end dates
* Discount depth and promotion type
* **External Calendars**
* Holidays
* Weather indicators
All data sources are ingested as append-only, time-stamped records to preserve historical state and enable backtesting.

**## Historical Coverage**
The system assumes access to sufficient historical data to capture recurring demand patterns and seasonality.
* **Minimum required history:**
* 12 months for basic trend and short-term forecasting
* 24–36 months preferred for stable seasonality learning
* **Coverage varies by SKU:**
* Long-lived SKUs have full historical depth
* New or discontinued SKUs may have partial or sparse history
Models and evaluations explicitly account for varying data availability across SKUs and locations.

**## Data Reliability Assumptions**
The system operates under the following data reliability assumptions:
* **Timestamps**
* Sales and inventory timestamps accurately reflect event time
* Timezones are normalized across sources
* **Missing Values**
* Zero sales represent true zero demand, not missing data
* Inventory snapshots may be missing intermittently but are monotonic between updates
* **Schema Stability**
* Core identifiers (SKU, location) remain stable over time
* Schema changes are backward compatible or versioned
* **Data Latency**
* Sales data may arrive with a known delay window
* Inventory updates are near real-time or end-of-day
Violations of these assumptions are surfaced via data validation checks and monitoring alerts.

**## Known Biases & Gaps**
The following biases and data gaps are acknowledged and handled explicitly
* **Sparse and Intermittent Demand**
* Long-tail SKUs with infrequent sales are underrepresented
* Special handling is required to avoid biased forecasts
* **Cold-Start SKUs and Stores**
* Newly launched products or stores lack sufficient history
* Forecasts rely on higher-level aggregates and analogs
* **Promotion Bias**
* Promotional periods dominate observed demand patterns
* Post-promotion normalization is required
* **Stock-Out Censoring**
* Observed zero sales during stock-outs do not reflect true demand
* Demand is partially unobserved in these periods
* **Historical Regime Shifts**
* Past data may reflect pricing, assortment, or supply conditions that no longer apply
These biases are documented and tracked to prevent misinterpretation of model outputs.
