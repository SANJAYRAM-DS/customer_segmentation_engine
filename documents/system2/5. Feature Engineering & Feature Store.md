**# Feature Design**
**## Feature Categories**
Features are grouped by business meaning, not by model, to ensure reuse, explainability, and consistency across forecasting and risk tasks.
**### Demand Features###**
* Lagged sales quantities at multiple horizons
* Rolling statistics (mean, variance, trend slope)
* Seasonality indicators (day-of-week, week-of-year)
* Demand intermittency indicators (zero-sales frequency)
**### Promotion & Calendar Features###**
* Promotion flags (planned, known ahead of time)
* Discount depth and promotion type
* Holiday and special event indicators
* Promotion recency and duration features
**### Supply & Inventory Features##**
* Current on-hand inventory
* Safety stock levels
* Supplier lead times (expected and historical variance)
* Replenishment cadence indicators
**### Risk & Volatility Features##**
* Demand volatility metrics
* Forecast uncertainty estimates
* Stock-out history frequency
* Inventory buffer ratios
Each feature has a clearly defined business interpretation and documented availability window.

**## Feature Stability##**
Features are designed to remain robust under demand shocks, promotions, and seasonal spikes.
* Rolling features use bounded windows to prevent overreaction to short-term anomalies
* Volatility-sensitive features are capped or normalized
* Promotion effects are modeled explicitly to avoid contaminating baseline demand signals
* Cold-start SKUs fall back to higher-level aggregate features
Feature distributions are continuously monitored to detect instability or regime shifts.

**## Missing Data Handling##**
The system applies explicit and consistent missing-data strategies:
* **### Missing sales:###**
* Treated as zero only when inventory is available
* Flagged as censored when stock-out is detected
* **### Missing inventory snapshots:###**
* Forward-filled within safe bounds
* Accompanied by staleness indicators
* **### Missing promotion data:###**
* Defaulted to “no promotion” only if confirmed
* **### New SKUs or stores:###**
* Use hierarchical aggregate features and analog-based proxies
Missingness itself is often encoded as a signal rather than silently imputed.

**## Feature Versioning##**
All features are versioned and auditable through a centralized feature registry.
* **### Each feature has:###**
* Name
* Definition
* Computation logic
* Time window
* Version identifier

* Changes to feature logic create new versions rather than overwriting existing ones
* Models are trained and served against immutable feature versions
* Historical predictions can always be reproduced using archived feature snapshots
Feature versioning ensures reproducibility, safe iteration, and controlled evolution of the system.
