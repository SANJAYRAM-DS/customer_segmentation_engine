# System Overview
## Business Objective
The Demand & Inventory Intelligence System exists to reduce revenue loss, customer dissatisfaction, and operational inefficiency caused by inaccurate demand estimation and delayed inventory decisions.
In a multi-SKU, multi-location environment, demand varies across time, geography, promotions, and seasonality. Manual forecastion methods and static reorder rules are insufficient to capture this complexity, leading to frequent stock-outs, excess inventory, and poor service levels.
This system provides data-driven demand forecasts and inventory risk signals that enable the business to proactively plan replenishment, optimize stock levels, and respond to demand volatility before it results in operational failure.

## Decisions Supported
This System informs the following explicit operational decisions:
* How many units of each SKU should be stocked for upcoming time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)
* When replenishment orders should be placed on forecast demand and supplier lead times
* Which SKUs and locations are at highest risk of stock-out and require urgent intervention
* How inventory should be balanced across product hierarchies(SKU, category, store, region)
* How demand is expected to change during promotions, holidays, or special events
The system does not automatically execute inventory actions; it provides ranked, risk-aware recommendations to support human decision-making and downstream planning systems.

## System consumers
The outputs of this system are consumed by both human users and downstream systems:
### Human Consumers
* Supply chain planners
* Inventory managers
* operations teams
* Finance and demand planning analysts
### System Consumers
* Replenishment planning tools
* ERP and inventory management systems
* Pricing and promotion system (for stock-aware pricing)
* Retention and growth systems (to avoide promoting out-of-stock items)

## Failure Impact
Incorrect or delayed predictions can have significant business impace:
* Under-forecasting demand may lead to stock-outs, lost sales, and customer dissatisfaction
* Over-forecasting demand may result in excess inventory, increased holding cost, and markdown losses
* Missed stock-out risk signals can cause operational firesighting and emergency replenishment costs
* False risk alerts can lead to unnecessary inventory movements and supplier strain
Because the cost of understocking is typically higher than overstocking, the system is designed to be risk-aware and asymmetric in error tolerance.

## Success Metrics
The success of the Demand & Inventory Intelligence System is measured through business-aligned KPIs, not just model accuracy:
* Reduction in stock-out incidents and lost-sales events
* Improvement in inventory turnover ratio
* Reduction in excess and obsolete inventory
* Improved service level during peak demand periods
* Improved forecast accuracy (MAE, WAPE) at SKU and location level
* Increased trust and adoption by supply chain teams
