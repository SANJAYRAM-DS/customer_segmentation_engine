# Explainability & Trust

## Purpose

This document defines **how predictions and risk scores are explained, interpreted, and audited** in System 2 (Demand & Inventory Intelligence).

The objectives are to:
- Make model outputs understandable to humans
- Enable informed operational decisions
- Support audits and post-mortems
- Prevent black-box behavior in production systems

Explainability is treated as a **core system capability**, not an optional add-on.

---

## 1. Forecast Explanations

### 1.1 Objective

Forecast explanations help users understand **why demand is predicted to change**, not just the predicted values.

All forecasts must be accompanied by structured explanations.

---

### 1.2 What Is Explained

The system explains the following components for each forecast:

#### Seasonality Effects
- Weekly patterns (e.g., weekday vs weekend behavior)
- Monthly cycles
- Yearly seasonality (holidays, annual demand cycles)

#### Promotion Impact
- Estimated uplift attributable to promotions
- Duration and magnitude of promotional effects
- Interaction with baseline demand

#### Trend & Momentum
- Long-term growth or decline direction
- Short-term momentum changes
- Regime shifts (e.g., post-promotion decay)

#### Demand Shocks
- Sudden spikes or drops
- External anomalies
- One-off events

Each explanation component is **time-indexed and quantified**.

---

### 1.3 How Forecast Explanations Are Exposed

Forecast explanations are exposed in **human-consumable formats**.

#### Decomposed Views
- Trend
- Seasonality
- Residual / unexplained component

These views allow users to visually inspect model behavior.

#### Feature Contribution Summaries
- Ranked feature influence per forecast
- Directional impact (increase/decrease)
- Normalized contribution scores

Feature explanations are consistent across model types.

#### Scenario Comparisons
- Forecast with promotions
- Forecast without promotions
- Delta explicitly highlighted

Scenario analysis supports planning and negotiation decisions.

---

### 1.4 Why Forecast Explainability Matters

Explainability enables:
- Planner trust
- Faster root cause analysis
- Better human overrides
- Reduced operational risk

Predictions without explanations are **not considered production-ready**.

---

## 2. Stock-Out Risk Reason Codes

### 2.1 Objective

Stock-out risk predictions must be **actionable**, not opaque.

Every risk score is accompanied by explicit reason codes.

---

### 2.2 Common Risk Drivers

The system identifies and reports key drivers such as:

- Demand spikes beyond historical norms
- Supplier lead time increases
- Inventory buffer depletion
- Promotion overlaps
- Forecast uncertainty expansion

Drivers are derived from **validated feature signals**, not heuristics.

---

### 2.3 Reason Code Representation

Risk explanations are presented as:

- Ranked list of contributing factors
- Human-readable descriptions
- Quantified contribution strength (where applicable)

Example:

- Promotion overlap (+35% risk)
- Lead time increase (+20% risk)
- Inventory buffer erosion (+15% risk)

---

### 2.4 Stability Guarantees

Reason code definitions are:
- Stable across model versions
- Backward compatible
- Documented centrally

This ensures continuity for downstream systems and audits.

---

### 2.5 Black-Box Prevention Policy

No downstream system may consume:
- Raw risk scores without reason codes
- Unexplained predictions
- Undocumented features

Opaque outputs are explicitly prohibited.

---

## 3. Historical Traceability

### 3.1 Explanations as First-Class Artifacts

Explanations are stored and versioned **alongside predictions**, not regenerated later.

They are immutable once written.

---

### 3.2 Stored Metadata

Each prediction record includes:

- Model version
- Feature snapshot reference
- Explanation metadata
- Reason codes
- Decomposition values

This metadata allows full reconstruction of decisions.

---

### 3.3 Audit Capabilities

The system supports:

- Reconstructing historical forecasts
- Explaining why a specific SKU stocked out
- Supporting compliance and regulatory reviews
- Enabling post-incident analysis

Historical explanations cannot be modified retroactively.

---

## 4. Design Guarantees Summary

This explainability framework guarantees:

- Human-understandable outputs
- Actionable risk insights
- Stable explanations across versions
- Full auditability

The system favors **transparent intelligence over opaque accuracy**.
